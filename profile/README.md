## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ [Intermodalics](https://www.intermodalics.ai) is a Belgian company that creates robotics and perception software, from a single capability to fully autonomous systems.
Our customers are high-tech companies, startups and research institutes world-wide.

👩‍💻 You will mainly find forks here of popular robotics software projects which we use for our customers or contribute improvements back to.

🍿 We keep a ['Blog from software to robots'](https://www.intermodalics.ai/blog-on-robotic-software) which has a focus on the robotic hardware/software capabilities and applications and less on the command line/code snippets.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
